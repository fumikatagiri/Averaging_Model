# Averaging_Model

Supplemental Dataset 1. A .zip file containing four bacterial count data files (tab-delimited text) for “AvrRpt2_ETI”, “AvrRpm1_ETI”, “flg22_PTI”, and “elf18_PTI”. Each has columns of genotype, treatment, replicate, flat, pot, and colony. The colony column has log10-transformed colony counts (colony forming unit/cm2). Although the data were originally reported in (2), these raw data were not published.

Supplemental Dataset 2. A .RData file (R workspace file) containing a list object, “ave.model.mats”, which contains the matrices for the averaging model for 2- to 7-gene systems (equivalents of matrix in Fig. TS1.1 in Text S1 for different number-gene systems).

Supplemental Dataset 3. An R script file (.r file), which was used to generate Fig. 5 from the data sets in Supplemental Dataset 1. It includes algorithms for selecting significant genes for the analysis and the averaging model. In the script, the object of a 3-gene or 4-gene matrix included in Supplemental Dataset 2 is called “rec.mx”, which is generated by a function, “make.rec.mx”.
